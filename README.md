# Weekly Reports

## Week One

First week was not the best one for me. I arrived here while being ill and didn't have internet at the house I am staying at. Moreover, game world pitches we had to present didn't go as planned, as my speaking skills in front of other people are not good. Although, others' game pitches were pretty cool and interesting. Some of them could've been put as our game, but we decided on another concept. Other than world game pitches, there was nothing I could talk about. The only thing is that I should definitely improve my talking skills. I don't talk much and that's the problem as I'm used to not sharing my ideas, which is a big problem in teams.
